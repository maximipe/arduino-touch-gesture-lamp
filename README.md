Arduino-touch-light-lamp
========================

This is my graduation project for my design degree. 
The program uses the data from an ultrasonic distance sensor to handle a servo motor connected to a an
iris placed on a desktop lamp, in a way that the user controlls the light intensity by manipulating
the circle of light projected on the surface.

When the hand gesture runs from the enlighted area towards the sensor, the sketch maps the distance to circular
movement to run the servo, in this case to gradually open the iris. When the user make a gesture that runs away 
from the sensor, the opposite occurs.
